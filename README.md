# CO-pilot
# Local Coding Assistant

This project is a Python-based coding assistant that operates locally on your machine. It leverages pre-trained language models from the `transformers` library by Hugging Face to generate text and engage in interactive conversations. This assistant is designed to help you brainstorm ideas, provide code suggestions, and discuss coding-related topics as you work on your development projects.

## Features
- **Local Execution:** The assistant runs entirely on your local machine, without needing an internet connection or external API keys.
- **Interactive Conversations:** Engage in real-time dialogues with the assistant to get coding tips, suggestions, and support.
- **Customizable:** Easily extend or modify the assistant's capabilities by integrating additional libraries or changing the underlying model.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```
  git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
```
 
Set Up a Virtual Environment:

```
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  
# On Windows use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
```

Install Required Dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the Assistant:

```
python app.py
```
Usage
Once the assistant is running, you can interact with it by typing your questions or commands. The assistant will respond with generated text based on your input.

Example Conversation
vbnet
Co-Pilot: Hi! I'm your local coding assistant. What are we working on today?

You: I need help with a Python function to reverse a string.

Co-Pilot: Sure! Here's a simple way to reverse a string in Python:

def reverse_string(s):
    return s[::-1]
Customization
To customize the assistant, you can:

### Change the Model: Edit the app.py file to load a different model from the transformers library.
Add Features: Integrate additional Python libraries or create new functions to extend the assistantâ€™s capabilities.
